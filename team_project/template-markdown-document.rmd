# Setup

Basic set up for the upcoming project. This first chunk is for libraries.

```{r, basic set up}
# Sources the file, in the same folder, to ru the command in that file
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)
library(knitr)
```

# Data Intake

This second chunk is to read in the data.

```{r, data intake}
df_raw <- read_csv("cog.csv", col_names = TRUE, progress = show_progress())

head(df_raw)
```

# Data Tidying

One thing we will have to do is come up with a score breakdown for the MOCA.

- are there subsections of hte MOCA that each should be scored?
- Are there total score groupings or categories?
- Can you score the MOCA if its incomplete?
