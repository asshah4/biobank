# Introduction

### Background

-   Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world [@Friedrich2017b]
-   CAD remains leading cause of death [@McAloon2016]
-   Up to 20% of patients with CAD have depression, and cardiovascular mortality is 3 times higher in patients with comorbid CAD and depression. [@Meijer2011; @Lichtman2014; @Jha2019]
-   No contemporary interventions, such as antidepressant medications, improve future adverse CAD-related outcomes [@Kronish2019]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The autonomic nervous system connects the brain and the heart. This presents a "neurocardiac perspective" on a common mechanistic pathway in both depression and CAD.** [@Taggart2011a; @Carney2017] [^1]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

*Heart rate variability can represent the current state of the ANS as a potential "biomarker" of neurocardiac health.*

**Heart Rate Fluctuations**

-   Fluctuations in the HR are mediated by sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) inputs to the sinoatrial node
-   Rapid fluctuations in HR reflect vagal/PNS control
-   Slower fluctuations in HR reflect SNS and PNS integartion, along with other influences

**HRV**

-   External influences such as activity, mental stress, etc
-   Internal period rhythms also exist: RSA, baroreceptor reflexes, circadian rhythm, RAAS/neuroendocrine secretions, etc

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are studying the novel non-linear HRV metric, **Dyx**, in both CAD and depression. **Dyx** is generated from the Poincare plot using the multipole method, which characterizes the *scatter* of variability of subsequent heart beats.[^2]

![Poincare plot of normal MPI (left) and abnormal MPI (right)](../figures/ijc-figure-1.jpg){width="70%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have shown using the non-linear HRV metric, Dyx, is a powerful predictor of CAD,[^3] and can also be a useful marker for depression.

### Study Aims

-   **Dyx** has not been prospectively evaluated as a biomarker of CAD (by angiography) and depression
-   Pilot study (below) examines this relationship in a prospective clinical cohort

![Overview of relationship to ANS dysfunction](../figures/figure_dag.png){width="70%"}

### Hypothesis

In participants at high risk for CAD:

1.  We hypothesize that elevated PHQ-9 scores will associate with abnormal HRV
2.  We hypothesize that abnormal HRV will associate with obstructive CAD (stenosis \> 70%).

# Methods

### Study overview

-   Emory Biobank [@Ko2017]
-   Prospective clinical cohort undergoing cardiac catherization
-   Indications: pre-op, heart transplant, UA, NSTEMI, STEMI, positive stress test
-   Angiographic severity indices measured by CASS / Gensini scores [@Gensini1983]
-   Psychological questionnaires: depression by PHQ9 ($\geq 10$ considered moderate-to-severe depression)

### ECG and HRV collection

-   ECG data is collected using the VivaLNK patch (6-24 hours of data per patient), starting AM of angioggraphy
-   HRV was generated through signal processing in Matlab (PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox)
-   HRV was blocked into averaged 1-hour segments for analysis
-   **Dyx** was also generated, which summarizes a Poincare plot by the ratio of the kurtoses of the y-axis and x-axis

![VivaLNK ECG Patch](../figures/vivalnk-patch.png){width="50%"}

### Statistical analysis

-   For this pilot study, the first hour of HRV was used (to control for procedural sedation, the effects of catherization, etc)
-   Linear/logistic regression models were used to predict depression by HRV
-   Linear/logistic regression models were used to predict CAD plaque burden by HRV

# Results

### Study Population {.shrink}

```{r}
df <- demo
df$adm_reason <- df_txt$adm_reason
df$gend <- df_txt$gend
df$race <- df_txt$race
df$setting <- df_txt$setting

# Relabel
attr(df$gend, "label") <- "Gender"
attr(df$blbmi, "label") <- "Body Mass Index"

# Add depression and CAD
df %<>% inner_join(., psych, by = "patid")
df %<>% inner_join(., angio_scores, by = "patid")
df$cad <- factor(ifelse(df$cass70 >= 1, 1, 0))
attr(df$sad, "label") <- "PHQ > 9"
attr(df$cad, "label") <- "CASS-70 >= 1"

# Remove missing
df %<>% subset(., !is.na(age))

# Table 1
compareGroups(~ age + gend + race + blbmi + setting + sad + cad, data = df) %>%
  createTable(., hide = c(gend = "Female"), show.p.overall = FALSE) %>%
  export2md(., format = "latex", size = 6, caption = "Population")
```

### Indications for Catherization {.shrink}

```{r}
# Temp
# Sig data from above
compareGroups(cad ~ adm_reason, data = df) %>%
  createTable(show.p.overall = FALSE) %>%
  export2md(., format = "markdown", size = 6, caption = "Admission Reason by Obstructive CAD Status")
```

-   The indications for catherization are broad
-   Different reasons or types of ANS dysfunction for each indication

# Discussion

### Interpretion of Findings

-   Depression is associated with ANS dysfunction, particularly decreases in HF HRV

-   CAD is not associated with HRV

    -   Other manifestations of CAD (e.g. ischemica and no obstructive CAD) are worth exploring
    -   *More low risk controls (no heart failure, normal stress tests) needed*

-   HRV reflects depression, but do not have evidence that it predicts CAD in this very high risk group (based on limited sample)

    -   *Need to evaluate interaction between CAD and depression*
