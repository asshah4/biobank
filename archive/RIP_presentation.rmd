# Introduction

### Background {.allowframebreaks}

![DAG](figures/figure_dag.png)

- Up to 20% of patients with CAD have depression, and cardiovascular mortality is 3 times higher in patients with comorbid CAD and depression. No current interventions exist that decrease this risk. 
- We have shown using the non-linear HRV metric, Dyx, is a powerful predictor of CAD, and can also be a useful marker for Depression. This is a pilot study examining the relationship between depression and CAD using HRV metrics

### Hypothesis

1. We hypothesize that elevated PHQ-9 scores will associate with abnormal HRV
1. We hypothesize that abnormal HRV will associate with obstructive CAD (stenosis > 70%), and that abnormal HRV will associate with a greater number of obstructed vessels in a dose-response manner

# Methods

- Using the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, we have an ongoing recruitment of a prospective cohort undergoing cardiac catherization
- Clinical history and biomarkers are generated (including blood samples)
- Psychological questionnaires are performed, including depression by PHQ9
- ECG data is collected using the VivaLNK patch (6-24 hours of data per patient)

### Depression scoring

- Each patient is given a questionnaire, the PHQ9
- The scores are validated and suggest severity/category of depression
- Scores >= 10 are considered moderate to severe depression, and accepted cut-off

### Cardiac catherization

- Every patient presents for cardiac catherization to be enrolled
- Are either inpatient or outpatient
- Etiology: pre-op, heart transplant, UA, NSTEMI, STEMI, positive stress test
- Scored by angiographic severity indices - CASS and Gensini scores

### Heart rate variability collection {.allowframebreaks} 

- ECG data was collected using the VivaLNK patch
- this records data for up to 72 hours
- ECG was started the AM of LHC, and continued for several hours after event
- HRV was generated through signal processing in Matlab (PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox)
- Frequency domain was log-transformed
- HRV was blocked into averaged 1-hour segments for analysis
- _Dyx_ was also generated, which summarizes a Poincare plot by the ratio of the kurtoses of the y-axis and x-axis

# Results

### Demographic description

```{r demographics, results = "asis"}

```

## Heart Rate Variability

### Quality of HRV data

- Arrhythmia, artifact were excluded from analysis
- Approximately 25% of the HRV data was considered unusuable and discarded

```{r}
df <- hrv_params

# HRV quality
compareGroups(data = df, ~ Duration + PercentNotAnalyzed + PercentLowQualityWind) %>%

# Discussion

### Interpretion of Findings

- Depression is associated with ANS dysfunction, particularly decreases in HF HRV
- CAD may have associations with ANS dysfunction that can be measured, but may require more complex analyses and adjustments
- HRV may serve as a marker for ANS dysfunction, and may be the mediating factor in patients with comorbid depression and CAD 

### Future Directions and Limitations

- Larger sample size
- Identify times of catherization to control for sedation
- Consider stratifying effects of medications (e.g. beta blockers)
- Subset of patients with first-time angina (versus known CAD)
- Cosinor/complex time series analyses
- Circadian / time-of-day adjustment
- Adjustment for risk factors
