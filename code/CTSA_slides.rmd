# Introduction

### Background

- Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world [@Friedrich2017b]
- CAD remains leading cause of death [@McAloon2016]
- Up to 20% of patients with CAD have depression, and cardiovascular mortality is 3 times higher in patients with comorbid CAD and depression. [@Meijer2011; @Lichtman2014; @Jha2019]
- No current interventions, such as treating depression, impact mortality or CAD outcomes [@Kronish2019]

__The autonomic nervous system connects the brain and the heart and is a common mechanistic pathway in both depression and CAD.__ [@Taggart2011a; @Carney2017] ^[Figure by OpenStax College]

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

_Heart rate variability can represent the current state of the ANS._

__Heart Rate Fluctuations__

- Fluctuations in the HR are mediated by sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) inputs to the sinoatrial node
- Rapid fluctuations in HR reflect vagal/PNS control
- Slower fluctuations in HR reflect SNS and PNS integartion, along with other influences

__HRV__

- External influences such as activity, mental stress, etc
- Internal period rhythms also exist: RSA, baroreceptor reflexes, circadian rhythm, RAAS/neuroendocrine secretions, etc

---

There are multiple methods of describing HRV: geometric, frequency, and non-linear.^[@Akselrod1981]

![Power spectral density measurements of HRV in experimental settings](figures/akselrod-hrv.png){height=70%}

---

We are studying the novel non-linear HRV metric, __Dyx__, in both CAD and depression. __Dyx__ is generated from the Poincare plot using the multipole method, calculated from the ratio of the kurtoses of the y-axis and x-axis.^[@Lewkowicz2002; @Shah2020]

![Poincare plot of normal MPI (left) and abnormal MPI (right)](figures/ijc-figure-1.jpg){width=70%}

---

We have shown using the non-linear HRV metric, Dyx, is a powerful predictor of CAD,^[@Shah2020] and can also be a useful marker for depression.

### Study Aims

This is a pilot study examining the relationship between depression and CAD using HRV metrics

![Overview of relationship to ANS dysfunction](figures/figure_dag.png){width=70%}

### Hypothesis

1. We hypothesize that elevated PHQ-9 scores will associate with abnormal HRV
1. We hypothesize that abnormal HRV will associate with obstructive CAD (stenosis > 70%), and that abnormal HRV will associate with a greater number of obstructed vessels in a dose-response manner

# Methods

### Study overview

- Using the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, we have an ongoing recruitment of a prospective cohort undergoing cardiac catherization [@Ko2017]
- Patients included have non-STEMI presentations, and preferentially those with no known CAD prior
- Clinical history and biomarkers are generated (including blood samples)
- Psychological questionnaires are performed, including depression by PHQ9
- ECG data is collected on all patients

### Depression scoring

- Each patient is given a questionnaire, the PHQ9
- The scores are validated and suggest severity/category of depression
- Scores >= 10 are considered moderate to severe depression, and accepted cut-off

### Cardiac catherization

- Every patient presents for cardiac catherization to be enrolled
- Are either inpatient or outpatient
- Etiology: pre-op, heart transplant, UA, NSTEMI, STEMI, positive stress test
- Scored by angiographic severity indices - CASS and Gensini scores [@Gensini1983]

### ECG and HRV collection

- ECG data is collected using the VivaLNK patch (6-24 hours of data per patient)
- ECG was started the AM of LHC, and continued for several hours after event
- HRV was generated through signal processing in Matlab (PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox)
- HRV was blocked into averaged 1-hour segments for analysis
- __Dyx__ was also generated, which summarizes a Poincare plot by the ratio of the kurtoses of the y-axis and x-axis

![VivaLNK ECG Patch](figures/vivalnk-patch.png){width=50%}

### Statistical analysis

- For this pilot study, the first hour of HRV was used (to control for procedural sedation, the effects of catherization, etc)
- Linear/logistic regression models were used to predict depression by HRV
- Linear/logistic regression models were used to predict CAD plaque burden by HRV

# Discussion

### Interpretion of Findings

- Depression is associated with ANS dysfunction, particularly decreases in HF HRV
- CAD may have associations with ANS dysfunction that can be measured, but may require more complex analyses and adjustments
- HRV may serve as a marker for ANS dysfunction, and may be the mediating factor in patients with comorbid depression and CAD 

### Future Directions and Limitations

- Larger sample size
- Identify times of catherization to control for sedation
- Consider stratifying effects of medications (e.g. beta blockers)
- Subset of patients with first-time angina (versus known CAD)
- Cosinor/complex time series analyses
- Circadian / time-of-day adjustment
- Adjustment for risk factors
- __Interaction between CAD and depression__

# Conclusion

The ANS is a target that should be studied for potential interventions to reduce the excess cardiovascular risk in those with depression and coronary artery disease.
